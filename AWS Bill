Dear Amazon it is my pleasure to get this opportunity to learn Cloud in your huge platform. I am very thankful to you as you are providing this platform free of cost to community and students like me. I learned a lot about Cloud Computing and Big Data, because of Amazon I will touch my goal to be a Big Data specialist. But get surprised when I see billing section of my AWS account, I found that the bill amount is too high for me, as I am student and in the learning period so I donâ€™t have any recourses to earn money so I am not capable to pay the bill. The maximum charged amount of my bill amount is due is unknown to me as I was using all free services only.
So its my request to you Kindly wave off my bill.
Again I thank a lot of AWS.
Waiting for your positive response.
